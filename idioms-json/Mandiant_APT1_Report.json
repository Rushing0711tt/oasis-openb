The spear phishing emails contain\\n                            \\teither a malicious attachment or a hyperlink to a malicious file.

They offer the attacker a toe-hold to perform simple tasks like retrieve files, gather\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbasic system information and trigger the execution of other more significant capabilities such as a standard backdoor.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAPT1\\u2019s beachhead backdoors are usually what we call WEBC2 backdoors. WEBC2 backdoors are probably the most well-known\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tkind of APT1 backdoor, and are the reason why some security companies refer to APT1 as the \\u201cComment Crew.\\u201d A WEBC2 backdoor\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tis designed to retrieve a webpage from a C2 server. It expects the webpage to contain special HTML tags; the backdoor will attempt\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto interpret the data between the tags as commands. Older versions of WEBC2 read data between HTML comments, though over\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttime WEBC2 variants have evolved to read data contained within other types of tags. From direct observation, we can confirm\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthat APT1 was using WEBC2 backdoors as early as July 2006. However, the first compile time35 we have for WEBC2-KT3 is 2004-01-23, suggesting that APT1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thas been crafting WEBC2 backdoors since early 2004. Based on the 400+ samples of WEBC2 variants that we have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\taccumulated, it appears that APT1 has direct access to developers who have continually released new WEBC2 variants for over six years.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFor example, these two build paths, which were discovered inside WEBC2-TABLE samples, help to illustrate how APT1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thas been steadily building new WEBC2 variants as part of a continuous development process:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<code>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Sample A</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMD5: d7aa32b7465f55c368230bb52d52d885\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCompile date: 2012-02-23\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\\work\\\\code\\\\2008-7-8muma\\\\mywork\\\\winInet_winApplication2009-8-7\\\\mywork\\\\aaaaaaa2012-2-23\\\\Release\\\\aaaaaaa.pdb\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</code>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<code>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Sample B</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMD5: c1393e77773a48b1eea117a302138554\\n \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCompile date: 2009-08-07\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tD:\\\\work\\\\code\\\\2008-7-8muma\\\\mywork\\\\winInet_winApplication2009-8-7\\\\mywork\\\\aaaaaaa\\\\Release\\\\aaaaaaa.pdb\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</code>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tA \\u201cbuild path\\u201d discloses the directory from which the programmer built and compiled his source code.

We first published details about the APT in our January 2010 M-Trends report. As we stated in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\treport, our position was that \"The Chinese government may authorize this activity, but there&#8217;s no way to determine the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\textent of its involvement.\" Now, three years later, we have the evidence required to change our assessment. The details\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twe have analyzed during hundreds of investigations convince us that the groups conducting these activities are based\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tprimarily in China and that the Chinese Government is aware of them.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t&lt;/P&gt;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t&lt;p&gt;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMandiant continues to track dozens of APT groups around the world; however, this report is focused on the most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tprolific of these groups. We refer to this group as \"APT1\" and it is one of more than 20 APT groups with origins in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tChina. APT1 is a single organization of operators that has conducted a cyber espionage campaign against a broad\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\trange of victims since at least 2006. From our observations, it is one of the most prolific cyber espionage groups in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tterms of the sheer quantity of information stolen. The scale and impact of APT1&#8217;s operations compelled us to write this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\treport.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t&lt;/P&gt;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t&lt;p&gt;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe activity we have directly observed likely represents only a small fraction of the cyber espionage that APT1 has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tconducted. Though our visibility of APT1&#8217;s activities is incomplete, we have analyzed the group&#8217;s intrusions against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnearly 150 victims over seven years. From our unique vantage point responding to victims, we tracked APT1 back\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto four large networks in Shanghai, two of which are allocated directly to the Pudong New Area. We uncovered a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsubstantial amount of APT1&#8217;s attack infrastructure, command and control, and modus operandi (tools, tactics, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tprocedures). In an effort to underscore there are actual individuals behind the keyboard, Mandiant is revealing three\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpersonas we have attributed to APT1. These operators, like soldiers, may merely be following orders given to them by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tothers.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t&lt;/P&gt;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t&lt;p&gt;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOur analysis has led us to conclude that APT1 is likely government-sponsored and one of the most persistent of China&#8217;s\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcyber threat actors. We believe that APT1 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tin large part because it receives direct government support. In seeking to identify the organization behind this activity,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tour research found that People&#8217;s Liberation Army (PLA&#8217;s) Unit 61398 is similar to APT1 in its mission, capabilities, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tresources. PLA Unit 61398 is also located in precisely the same area from which APT1 activity appears to originate.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t&lt;/P&gt;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t&lt;/body&gt;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t&lt;/html&gt;\n\nINTENT:\nThreat Actor Report",
